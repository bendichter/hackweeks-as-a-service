# Expectations of Tutorial Leads

Hackweek tutorials provide a forum for everyone to learn new things in an interactive and welcoming environment. As tutorial leads, we have unique opportunities to create positive learning spaces, to share our knowledge and to learn from each other.

The most important role of a tutorial lead is to exemplify the [core values](overview) of the hackweek model. How might these values be expressed during your tutorial work? Here are a few examples:

* We can _empower one another_ by meeting participants where they are and embracing the idea that each of us is on a lifelong journey of learning
* We can _express gratitude_ by offering appropriate feedback and explicitly acknowledging participant's efforts 
* We can _build community_ by actively facilitating a positive and trustworthy learning space, and enforcing Code of Conduct violations
* We can by _inclusive_ by welcoming all learners and offering content in a variety of formats

## Time Commitment

We will work with you to build a tutorial design team in the months preceding your event. This usually involves a series of 8 to 10 one hour biweekly planning calls where we will work with you to get clear on learning outcomes, tutorial design and the technical aspects of tutorial building. This is in addition to any time you spend during the hackweek to teach material.

## What can I expect to gain from this experience?

Hackweeks have traditionally been very dynamic events at which knowledge is exchanged in multiple directions across different levels of career position and backgrounds. We hope you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things by engaging in this experience. Past tutorial leads have used these events to gain teaching experience and as a way to round out their teaching profile. Like other participants you can also expect to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.
