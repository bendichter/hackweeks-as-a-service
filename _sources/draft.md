During our initial consultation meeting we will have a conversation about the overall purpose of your event

* decide on the purpose of your event: which components of the hackweek model do you hope to prioritize? This will drive subsequent design and budget discussions.
* designate a leader or leadership team responsible for general coordination and planning
* create an initial roadmap for the hackweek:
    * *when* do you want the event to occur? 
    * *how/where* will the event be hosted? In person, virutally, or some combination?
    * *who* is available to assist? Tutorial leads, helpers and project mentors often play important roles.
