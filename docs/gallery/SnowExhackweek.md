# SnowEx Hackweek

We've hosted two NASA SnowEx-events in 2021 and 2022. Read more at https://snowex.hackweek.io and reflections on the 2021 event below:

## 2021

[SnowEx Hackweek 2021](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/intro.html) was offered virtually July 12 - 16 with over 100 participants. The purpose of the event was to foster an environment of collaboration and sharing of NASA SnowEx datasets across teams. [Fifteen tutorials](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/tutorials/index.html) were offered on topics spanning open science tools, SnowEx data access and machine learning.

Of the 45 respondents to our post-hackweek survey, all reported that this hackweek was useful for their career and that they learned things that improved their day to day research ({numref}`snowex-impacts`). 98 percent of respondents agreed that the skills learned would be useful outside of academia.
