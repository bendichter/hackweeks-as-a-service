# Tutorial Planning Checklist

This page details all the steps that the tutorial planning team progresses through as they develop tutorial content for a hackweek.

The work described here is informed by the [general hackweek mission](../mission). It also assumes that the hackweek leadership team has defined three specific goals for this particular event.


## Assembling the Tutorial Planning Team

The tutorial planning team is responsible for deciding what will be taught at the hackweek, how it will be taught and who will do the work of designing and delivering content.

The roles in the tutorial planning team include the Lead Education Coordinator, The Education Consultant, Tutorial Leads and Tutorial Helpers. These roles are detailed on our <> page.

### Build a list of potential team members

The first step is to build a list of everyone who might be invited to be a part of the tutorial planning team. The leadership team should choose people who they think will contribute to creating a positive learning experience for participants. They should also choose people who have experience with the topics described by the three hackweek goals. 

This list is generated from:

* reviewing all applicants who indicated in their application form that they are interested in offering a tutorial
* considering people who have been involved in past hackweeks (if they exist for this community)
* selecting people in the networks of the lead organizing team
* consulting with the eScience Institute for recommendations and connections
* advertising withing existing community structures (e.g. science team meetings, listservers) requesting participation

### Create a high level schedule

Although we primarily develop schedules and content together with the full tutorial design team, it often helps to have a sketched out draft schedule as a starting point. The lead organizers are encouraged to lay out general themes, for example using a Kanban board in a GitHub projects page (see [this example from the ICESat-2 hackweek](https://github.com/orgs/ICESAT-2HackWeek/projects/3)).

### Communicate with potential team members

At this stage we are ready to connect with people from our list of potential team members. We recommend a communication between the existing leadership team and potential education team members that follows this structure:

* introduce the hackweek goals and share general information about the mission of our hackweeks 
* sharing links to our existing draft schedule 
* listening to the invitee's ideas for content they would like to contrubite within the framework of our goals
* providing details about responsibilities, time commitments and scheduling
* listing the various ways we can offer recognition for their effort

These communications can occur in any fashion. We have found that 30 minute zoom calls, distributed across several members of the leadership team, are a worthwhile use of time to build these initial connections.

### Finalizing the education team

Now the leadership team is ready to finalize the list of people on the education team. If several people have taken part in the communications above, they should meet to discuss the outcomes and decide on the final list of people to be invited for this event. Communications should be sent out with an invitation to join our various communication channels and to schedule the opening kickoff meeting.
