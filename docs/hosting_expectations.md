# Things you will need 

Part of our process in working with your event will be to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of our support team and those of your local planning team. These are our general expectations of roles that would be covered by your team:

## Lead coordinator(s)

Typically we work with 1 to 3 lead coordinators of the local planning team. These are often the people who came up with the idea for the hackweek and who are committed to being the main points of contact with our team. Roles and responsibilities of lead coordinator(s) are:

| Role  | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| General oversight   | Oversee and lead activities of the local planning team  |
| Budgeting and reporting | Negotiate details of the services contract and interface with the funding agency supporting the event; issue reports on funding as needed |
| Tutorial coordination | Gather tutorial leads from the community; lead coordinator for activities of the tutorial design team | 
| Technical lead | Helps everyone on the local planning team navigate working with GitHub and our shared computing resources | 

## Interactive learning spaces for in-person events

For hackweeks offered entirely or partially in-person, the local team is responsible for reserving an active learning classroom that has technology tools to support interactive learning.

## People to Design and Deliver Tutorials

If your hackweek includes tutorials your role will be to find individuals to teach tutorials and decide what specific topics will be covered. Our team can connect you with resources for finding tutorial support through organizations such as [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) or [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/).
